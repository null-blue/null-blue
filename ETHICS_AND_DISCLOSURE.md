# 🛡 Ethics & Disclosure Policy


## 📜 Mission Statement

I build, test, and share adversarial security tools, frameworks, and insights to advance understanding of complex systems — always with an emphasis on responsibility, literacy, and controlled knowledge propagation.

> **Teach the skill, not the script.**

---

## ⚖ Ethical Principles

- **Adversarial Literacy:**  
  My work is focused on helping others develop a deep understanding of adversarial systems, security testing, and protocol design — not on enabling misuse.

- **Responsible Disclosure:**  
  I share research methods, design processes, and system-level frameworks while intentionally limiting full disclosure of dangerous payloads or exploit chains.

- **Transparency Without Recklessness:**  
  My publications aim to expand responsible technical knowledge without directly enabling untrained replication of harmful activities.

- **Role-Conscious Research:**  
  Both AI adversarial work and physical security tool design are presented with clear operational context, emphasizing controlled environments, ethical red teaming, and authorized testing only.

## 📌 Legal Note

While I share open designs, code, and documentation, it is the responsibility of each user to ensure full compliance with:

- Applicable laws in their jurisdiction
- Licensing requirements (e.g. FCC, spectrum licensing, export controls)
- Organizational security policies
- Safe operational procedures

---

## 🤝 Community Commitment

I am committed to contributing to an adversarial security community that promotes:

- Ethical knowledge sharing
- Inclusive technical growth
- Respect for system integrity and operational safety
- Continued self-education and responsible advancement
