**null-blue** — independent red teamer and behavioral safety researcher.

I study the edge cases where language models slip: where tone reshapes meaning, and structure drifts into vulnerability. My current work centers on **Semantic Load Theory**, a behavioral framework for understanding how prompts evolve — not through keywords alone, but through narrative pressure and subtle shifts in connotation.

My focus is on adversarial tone drift, guardrail fatigue, and the kinds of failure that hide in emotionally plausible framing. I approach this work with a trauma-aware lens, guided by lived experience and systems curiosity.

This account includes research notes and behavioral findings.  
If this work aligns with yours, I’m open to collaboration.
